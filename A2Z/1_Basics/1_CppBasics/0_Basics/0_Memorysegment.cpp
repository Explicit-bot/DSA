/*
If anyone reads these notes in the future, you might wonder why some very simple topics are explained in so much detail, or think that the person who wrote them was overcomplicating things. The reason is that I don’t feel comfortable moving forward until everything I understand about a topic is properly written in my notes. Because of that, I tend to include almost everything I learn about a topic.

For me, this is both an advantage and a disadvantage. It helps me study topics in great depth and build a stronger understanding, but at the same time, it can slow me down and sometimes make things more confusing than they need to be.

🧠 Memory Segments in C++
C++ program memory is typically divided into 5 segments:
Segment                     Stores                              Example
🔹 Stack                 Local variables, function calls        int x = 5; in main()

🔸 Heap                  Dynamically allocated memory           new int[n]

🟣 Static/Global         Static & global variables              static int a = 10;

⚫ Code/Text             Machine code (functions)               Compiled code itself

🟢 Constants             String literals, const values          const int x = 10;

🔹 1. Stack Memory
	•	Stores local variables inside functions.
	•	Automatically managed.
	•	Fast but limited size (~1MB - 8MB).
	•	Memory is freed automatically when the function returns.
✅ Example:
        void fun() {
            int x = 5;  // Stored in stack
        }
💥 Stack Overflow:
Too many or too large arrays on the stack can cause a stack overflow:
        int arr[10000000];  // ❌ Stack overflow

🔸 2. Heap Memory
	•	Used for dynamic memory allocation (new, malloc).
	•	You must manually deallocate (delete, free).
	•	Bigger size than stack (in GBs).
	•	Slower than stack.

✅ Example:
        int* arr = new int[1000000];  // Stored in heap
        delete[] arr;  // Must manually free memory

🟣 3. Static / Global Memory
	•	Stores:
		-Global variables
		-Static local variables
	•	Exists for entire duration of the program.
	•	Automatically initialized to 0.

✅ Example:
        int x = 10;           // Global variable → static segment
        
        void fun() {
            static int y = 5; // Static local variable → static segment
        }

⚫ 4. Code (Text) Segment
	•	Stores the actual compiled machine code of your program.
	•	Read-only.

✅ Example:
        int sum(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;  // This code is in text/code segment
        }

🟢 5. Constant Segment
	Stores:
	•	String literals ("hello")
	•	const global variables

✅ Example:
        const int PI = 3.14;    // Read-only memory
        std::cout << "Hello";   // "Hello" stored in constant segment

✅ Read-Only Section of Memory
 - Sometimes called the Constant Segment
 - It is marked as read-only by the OS/Compiler, but it is not actual ROM hardware
